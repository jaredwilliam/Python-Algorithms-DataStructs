    "\n",
    "First, realizing that if a key wasn't present in a dictionary, that the key would automatically be added. This would eliminate the if/else statement in the first for loop - I would just have to loop through the array and count the numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second simplification was realizing that keys in dictionaries can be integers. This would have saved me some key strokes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Third, I could have made the dictionary based off the second array and followed the same decrementing approach I took. This would allow me to check the values along the way, eliminating the third for loop, because if the value in the dictionary for the associated number in the first array that is currently being checked is equal to 0, we know that it is the missing element.
